  abstract = {Author Summary An increasing number of scientific disciplines, and biology in particular, rely on complex computational models. The utility of these models depends on how well they are fitted to empirical data. Fitting is achieved by searching for suitable values for the models' input parameters, in a process known as calibration. Modern computer models typically have a large number of input and output parameters, and long running times, a consequence of their increasing computational complexity. The above two things hinder the calibration process. In this work, we propose a method that can help the calibration of models with long running times and several inputs and outputs. We apply this method on an individual based, dynamic and stochastic HIV model, using HIV data from Uganda. The final system has a 65\% probability of selecting an input parameter set that fits all 18 model outputs.},
