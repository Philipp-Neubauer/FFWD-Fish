	abstract = {In many scientific disciplines complex computer models are used to understand the behaviour of large scale physical systems. An uncertainty analysis of such a computer model known as Galform is presented. Galform models the creation and evolution of approximately one million galaxies from the beginning of the Universe until the current day, and is regarded as a state-of-the-art model within the cosmology community. It requires the specification of many input parameters in order to run the simulation, takes significant time to run, and provides various outputs that can be compared with real world data. A Bayes Linear approach is presented in order to identify the subset of the input space that could give rise to acceptable matches between model output and measured data. This approach takes account of the major sources of uncertainty in a consistent and unified manner, including input parameter uncertainty, function uncertainty, observational error, forcing function uncertainty and structural uncertainty. The approach is known as History Matching, and involves the use of an iterative succession of emulators (stochastic belief specifications detailing beliefs about the Galform function), which are used to cut down the input parameter space. The analysis was successful in producing a large collection of model evaluations that exhibit good fits to the observed data.},

	abstract = {Computer model evaluation studies build statistical models of deterministic simulation-based predictions of field data to then assess and criticize the computer model and suggest refinements. Computer models are often expensive computationally: statistical models that adequately emulate their key features can be very much more efficient. Gaussian process models are often used as emulators, but the resulting computations lack the ability to scale to higher-dimensional, time-dependent or functional outputs. For some such problems, especially for contexts of time series outputs, building emulators using dynamic linear models provides a computationally attractive alternative as well as a flexible modelling approach capable of emulating a broad range of stochastic structures underlying the input-output simulations. We describe this here, combining Bayesian multivariate dynamic linear models with Gaussian process modelling in an effective manner, and illustrate the approach with data from a hydrological simulation model. The general strategy will be useful for other computer model evaluation studies with time series or functional outputs.},

	abstract = {Author Summary An increasing number of scientific disciplines, and biology in particular, rely on complex computational models. The utility of these models depends on how well they are fitted to empirical data. Fitting is achieved by searching for suitable values for the models' input parameters, in a process known as calibration. Modern computer models typically have a large number of input and output parameters, and long running times, a consequence of their increasing computational complexity. The above two things hinder the calibration process. In this work, we propose a method that can help the calibration of models with long running times and several inputs and outputs. We apply this method on an individual based, dynamic and stochastic HIV model, using HIV data from Uganda. The final system has a 65\% probability of selecting an input parameter set that fits all 18 model outputs.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},
